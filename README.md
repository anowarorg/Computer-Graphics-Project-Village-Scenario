# Computer Graphics Project: Village-Scenario
## Introduction
Graphics provide a natural means of communicating with computers, leveraging our 2D and 3D pattern recognition abilities. This project explores interactive computer graphics to create an animated landscape featuring a boat, birds, and various elements. The goal is to showcase the potential of computer graphics in conveying both real-world and abstract scenarios.

## Overview
This project uses an editor that enables users to draw and paint using a mouse, along with other functions like drawing lines, circles, and polygons. Interactive construction techniques, such as basic positioning, rubber-band methods, and dragging, make the tool user-friendly. The project depicts a village scenario, emphasizing the versatility of computer graphics in creating diverse visual narratives.

## Tools and Technologies
To run and develop this project, needs:
1. A Computer or laptop.
2. CodeBlocks software installed.
3. C/C++ programming language for drawing computer graphics projects.
4. OpenGL.
5. VS Code (CodeBlocks Alternative). 

## Project Description

1. Objects.
2. Birds.
3. Sun.
4. Clouds.
5. Blue Water Lake.
6. Green Hills.
7. Trees.
8. Boat.
9. Home.
## Object Types

Various object types, including triangles, rectangles, circles, and polygons, contribute to the visual richness of the landscape.

## Algorithms Used

The project relies on OpenGL functions for drawing, providing a powerful framework for creating visually appealing scenes.

## Object Functionality

Each object serves a specific purpose, enhancing the overall aesthetic. For example:

1. The boat moves on the water.
2. Birds fly across the sky.
3. Hills and trees contribute to the landscape.
## Object Shapes

Diverse shapes, such as triangles, rectangles, circles, and polygons, are employed for different objects, adding variety to the visual composition.

## Movement
### Moving Objects

Two objects exhibit movement:
1. Birds.
2. Boat.

## Objects in Motion

### Birds: Horizontal motion in a periodic manner.
### Boat: Horizontal movement on the water.

## Movement Function

Both birds and the boat move back and forth, creating a dynamic and animated effect.

 ## Happy Coding!!!
